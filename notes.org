'C-SPC' Set Mark
'C-x C-x' Go back to previous mark... though this sets a mark before going back

Using univeral argement with the mark command.
'C-u C-SPC' Cycle back through the mark ring

I am using TransientMarkMode and do not want to begin highlighting
when all I want is to save my place, the possible commands are
'C-SPC C-g' Set Mark and then abort the command or...
'C-SPC C-SPC' Probably much quicker.
